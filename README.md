## L'Ecuyer-sim-streams

Example code for running simulations using a separate seed for each simulation, 
generated using the L'Ecuyer pseudo-random number generator algorithm for 
separate streams (L'Ecuyer e.a., 1999 and 2002). The intent is to increase the
probability that all the simulations are independent, with no overlapping 
streams. Should only be needed for complex or huge simulations.
